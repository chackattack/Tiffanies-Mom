<h3 a id="frenemy">My Friend Tiffanie</h3>
	<p>Let me start off by saying that Tiffy and I are now friends. We don't see each other or talk very often but I'd like to think that we have a special relationship due to length of it. Tiffy and I went to the same preschool and elementary K-8 school, so we have been friends for a long time. However, in my earliest memories of her, Tiffanie was the definition of a bossy bitch, or as Sheryl Sandberg would say, she has executive leadership skills (in manipulation and dark arts). I was a very outgoing and active kid, but somehow Tiffanie would able to always get under my skin. Since we were trapped in a very small school-with only 25 kids in a small classroom 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 9 years- we were very acquainted with each other. Life was really tough for me the first 6 or so years of school. Tiffanie made sure of it. She was always making fun of me for being too fat, too tall, too smart, too slow, too fast, too dumb. Tiffanie, along with other my other bullies Susan and Wendy- who all would later become my best friends years later, made me play the slave girl or the ugly step-sister when we played house. Since our parents were friends, we also hung out on weekends. They'd find my diary and posts my secrets at school or hide my favorite stuffed animals. It's in these years that I become emotionally unavailable and apathy, but probably also gained my outer perkiness and cheer. </p>
	

<h3 id="childhood-memories">My First Memories of Tiffanie's Mom</h3>
	<p>Tiffanie's mom would pick me up and take me to her grandpa's house when my mom forgot me. Tiffanie's mom would do practice Spelling Bees with me before spelling tests. Tiffanie's mom asked if I was okay when I cried. </p>
	<p>It made sense that Tiffanie was a bully to me, her classmate and friend, but it was surprising that Tiffanie was also equally, if not more, vicious to adults who I was raised to respect. Adults learned to give Tiffanie her way because she could throw tantrums like nobody's business. One time Tiffanie's Mom took Tiffy and I prom dress shopping. Tiffanie saw a white almost-wedding dress that was $200-300 dollars. At the time, that amount of money for a dress blew my mind. My family was very middle class, but I was raised with communist China mentality. She tried it the dress and she was determined to have it. At the time, her mom said she couldn't afford that dress, that they should look at other dresses and come back. Even at 16 years old, Tiffanie threw a fit. On the way home, Tiffanie's Mom got me fries from a drive-in and offered some to Tiffanie. My parents hate shopping, so I was really grateful at the American mother daughter parenting. Tiffy took the fries and threw one at her mom, called her mom fat bitch that didn't love her, and worse. I haven't seen Tiffy in a long time since this was 3 years after 8th grade, so I was half-accustomed to her whiney behavior, but also very taken aback. Didn't she realize that her mom drove an entire hour for us to go to the mall? That she spent this entire evening out with us instead of doing something that could've gave HER joy? </p>

Went to all the games and practices
She's Chinese like me, but also American. 


<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>Maybe it was Tiffanie's Mom's fault that she had such bratty, selfish kids. She overcompensated. She made being a superhero seem so easy. In trying to play the mom and dad role, she ended up seeming invincible.</p>

<h3 id="my-relationship">My Experiences with Tiffanie's Mom</h3>
<p>When I felt very sick on my sofa, my mom thought I was overreacting and my dad said I've been going out too much. (He's a Chinese homebody so he always thinks I'm out too much) Tiffanie's mom saw me on the sofa and was immediately concerned. She asked if I was okay. Even so, I am so used to my parents sink or swim approach that Tiffanie's mom's empathy really touched me. What does it mean to have someone nurture you when you are sick? Or care when you were mauled by a dog? To have someone worried about your broken heart?</p>


<h3 id="interest">Interest</h3>
<p>I am still trying to find a boyfriend for Tiffanie's Mom. She has not been romantically linked to anyone since her divorce 20 years ago. If anyone in this world deserves love, it's Tiffanie's Mom. I hope she had a secret lover somewhere.</p>

<h3 id="mom-hood">Momhood</h3>
<p>How did she manage to be everywhere at once? Having a child is hard, having 2 is harder, having 2 alone? Tiffanie's mom somehow sent both of her kids to 9 years of a private Catholic school AND afterschool activities. Her kids were her entire life. The idea of having ONE child with a loving, supportive partner is already scary enough. Even Superman could take off his suit at night, Tiffanie's Mom had to wear hers all the time.</p>

<h3 id="lessons">My Lessons</h3>
<p>Life is really unfair, but as they say, the most likely outcome of what will happen, is what you expect to happen. Tiffanie's mom chose this to be her life. Very early on, she chose her definition of victory. All she wanted in life was healthy, happy children. Everything in her life revolved around her kids. I wonder what it must be for her now, for her entire life's work to be grown up, getting married, having their own kids? I trust that her kids will be housing her and treating her like the queen that she deserves. Maybe her kids were the ones that gave her that strength to be such an amazing mom and person. But if that was some innate superpower, she probably could've taken over the world, or been the CEO of some major company. </p>
